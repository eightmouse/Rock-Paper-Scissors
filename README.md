# Rock-Paper-Scissors

Small RPS project made in JavaScript.

## EDIT - May 25 / 2023
I declare this project concluded!
This definitely helped me strengthen my (still limited) knowledge of JS,
it has been definitely funny and frustrating (of course) but I enjoyed it regardless.

## EDIT - June 19 / 2023
Final edit, I've reworked the code entirely with the extra knowledge I acquired and Google, hehe.
Added a simple UI that lets you play the game easily.
Fun experience and definitely challenging!
